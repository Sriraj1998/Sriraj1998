## Hi there 👋

## Sriraj Nair here :)

Full-stack engineer building apps that matter.
Founder of FitNSet. -> www.fitandset.com

I focus on scalable systems, intelligent automation, and building products that people actually use.

About

I work across frontend, backend, mobile, and AI systems. My approach is product-first — performance, clean architecture, and real-world usability matter more than hype.

## Strong in Expo , Next.js, React (&native), Java

Experience with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch

Building AI features using RAG architectures, vector databases, and LLM integrations


## FitNSet

FitNSet is an AI-powered fitness platform connecting trainers and clients through structured tracking, engagement systems, and intelligent insights.

What I'm building:

Workout and habit tracking

Progress photo systems with structured storage

Trainer–client management workflows

AI-assisted recommendations

Engagement analytics and retention mechanisms

Scalable backend architecture designed for growth

The goal is to make fitness accountability measurable, data-driven, and scalable.
